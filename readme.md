# Multi-digit IO (bare-metal) using a 4x4 matrix keypad, 4-digit segmented display, and an STM32f407

Credit to [cpq](https://github.com/cpq) and his [bare-metal programming guide](https://github.com/cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide) for getting me started with bare-metal programming. This guide introduced me to basic HAL structure, linker scripts, startup code, and syscalls. Much of the foundation of my project comes from his guide.

### More details about my project - including a video demonstration, circuit diagram, and an explanation of the key concepts I learned - will be added in the future.
